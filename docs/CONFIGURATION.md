# Configuration

All environment variables are validated at boot by
`src/config/env.validation.ts` — the app refuses to start rather than
run with a missing or malformed value. See
[`.env.example`](../.env.example) for the full list and
[`docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`](AUTHENTICATION.md) /
[`docs/NON_CUSTODIAL.md`](NON_CUSTODIAL.md) for what `JWT_SECRET` and
`PLATFORM_SIGNER_SECRET` are actually used for.

## Checks beyond per-variable format

Besides each variable's own format, `validate()` refuses to start when:

- **`JWT_SECRET` is weak.** Every environment requires at least 32
  characters. With `NODE_ENV=production` the secret must also contain at
  least 10 distinct characters and must not look like a placeholder: after
  lower-casing and removing punctuation, it may not contain `changeme`,
  `replaceme`, `yoursecret`, `jwtsecret`, `secretkey`, `mysecret`,
  `placeholder`, `example`, `default`, `insecure`, `donotuse` or `password`.
  Generate one with `openssl rand -base64 48`. The same rules apply to a
  secret loaded through a [secret provider](#secret-providers).
- **`SOROBAN_RPC_URL` and `STELLAR_NETWORK` disagree.** The network
  passphrase that transactions are signed with comes from `STELLAR_NETWORK`.
  The app can't reach the RPC at boot, so it infers the RPC's network from
  its URL instead: a host or path segment named `testnet`, `futurenet`,
  `mainnet` or `pubnet` (for example `soroban-testnet.stellar.org` or
  `rpc-futurenet.stellar.org`). If that network differs from
  `STELLAR_NETWORK`, startup fails. URLs that name no network, or more than
  one, pass this check; that covers self-hosted or local nodes such as
  `http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc`. `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` must be an `http`
  or `https` URL.

## API path prefix

Set `API_PREFIX` (for example `api` or `api/v1`) to serve every route under
that path when the API is hosted behind a reverse proxy at a sub-path. With
`API_PREFIX=api/v1`, `POST /auth/login` becomes `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
`GET /health` stays at the root so load-balancer and orchestrator probes
don't have to change. Leave it unset or empty to keep the current root
paths. Leading and trailing slashes are ignored. Only URL-safe path segments
are accepted, and `.` or `..` segments are rejected.

## Secret providers

`JWT_SECRET` is read through a pluggable `SecretProvider`
(`src/config/secrets/secret-provider.ts`), chosen with `SECRETS_PROVIDER`:

| `SECRETS_PROVIDER` | Reads `JWT_SECRET` from | Required variables |
|---|---|---|
| `env` (default) | the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable | `JWT_SECRET` |
| `file` | the file at `JWT_SECRET_FILE`, with surrounding whitespace trimmed | `JWT_SECRET_FILE` |
| `custom` | the provider passed to `SecretsModule.forRoot({ provider })` | — |

`file` works with Docker and Kubernetes secrets, and with secrets-manager
sidecars that mount values as files, such as Vault Agent or the AWS and GCP
Secrets Store CSI drivers. With `file`, the secret never has to be in the
process environment.

To read the secret straight from a secrets manager instead, implement the
interface and register the class in `src/app.module.ts`:

```ts
@Injectable()
export class VaultSecretProvider implements SecretProvider {
  readonly name = 'vault';

  constructor(private readonly config: ConfigService) {}

  async getSecret(key: string): Promise<string | undefined> {
    // Fetch `key` from your secrets manager here.
  }
}

// app.module.ts
SecretsModule.forRoot({ provider: VaultSecretProvider }),
```

Then start the app with `SECRETS_PROVIDER=custom`. The secret is resolved
once at boot (`src/auth/jwt-secret.module.ts`) and is used both to sign
tokens (`JwtModule`) and to verify them (`JwtStrategy`). If the secret is
missing, or fails the strength rules above, the app doesn't start. Rotating
the secret requires a restart, and a restart invalidates tokens already
issued.

| `JSON_BODY_LIMIT` | string | optional | `100kb` | yes | Maximum accepted JSON request body, as an Express size string such as 100kb or 1mb. Larger payloads are rejected with 413. Default 100kb.
| `CSP_DIRECTIVES` | string | optional | `{"defaultSrc":["'self'"],"scriptSrc":["'self'"]}` \* | yes | Helmet Content-Security-Policy directives as a JSON object string, e.g. {"defaultSrc":["'self'"]}. Leave unset to keep helmet's defaults.
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | string | **required** | — | yes | Soroban RPC endpoint the StellarService submits contract calls through.

| `OFFLINE_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEYS` | string | **required** | — | yes | JSON map of key id -> PEM-encoded Ed25519 public key. Every key a scanner should still accept, current and retired, so tokens signed before a rotation keep verifying until they expire.
| `PENDING_TX_RETENTION_MINUTES` | integer | optional | `60` | yes | How long a PendingTx row (build-transaction intent) stays valid before it's considered expired and eligible for cleanup.

| \* | | | | | The value used in code when the variable is unset. Commented out in `.env.example` because it only applies once the related optional feature is enabled. |

<!-- END GENERATED: env table -->

The table above is generated from `src/config/env.validation.ts` and
`.env.example` by `npm run docs:env`. Do not edit it by hand — edit one of
those two files and re-run the script. `npm run docs:check` fails if the two
sources have drifted apart, so a variable added to one but not the other
cannot land unnoticed.

**Validated at boot** means the app refuses to start when the value is missing
or malformed. A handful of variables are read directly by `ConfigService`
without going through validation — they are flagged **no** above. A typo in
one of those fails *silently* and the feature simply stays on its default, so
check the spelling if a flag or limit does not take effect.

## Security Headers (Helmet)

The API uses [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) with these defaults:
- `contentSecurityPolicy`: enabled (configurable via `CSP_DIRECTIVES`)
- `crossOriginEmbedderPolicy`: enabled
- `crossOriginOpenerPolicy`: enabled
- `crossOriginResourcePolicy`: enabled
- `dnsPrefetchControl`: enabled
- `frameguard`: enabled (deny)
- `hidePoweredBy`: enabled
- `hsts`: enabled (1 year, includeSubDomains)
- `ieNoOpen`: enabled
- `noSniff`: enabled
- `originAgentCluster`: enabled
- `referrerPolicy`: enabled (no-when-downgrade)
- `xssFilter`: enabled

Disabled headers (not needed for API-only backend):
- `x-powered-by`: removed by `hidePoweredBy`
- `x-dns-prefetch-control`: controlled by `dnsPrefetchControl`
