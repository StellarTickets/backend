# Testing

## Unit tests

Every service is unit tested with Prisma, `OrganizationsService`, and
`StellarService` mocked out — no real database or Soroban RPC call
happens in `npm test`. `StellarService` is mocked at the module level
(`jest.mock('../stellar/stellar.service', ...)`) rather than imported
for real, because `@stellar/stellar-sdk` ships transitive ESM-only
dependencies that need a wider `transformIgnorePatterns` to parse.

```bash
npm test          # run unit tests
npm run test:cov  # with coverage report
```

The coverage gate is configured in `package.json` (`coverageThreshold`).
CI fails if any global threshold (branches, functions, lines, statements)
drops below its minimum.

## End-to-end tests

The e2e suite in `test/` (files matching `*.e2e-spec.ts`) tests full HTTP
request/response flows against a real PostgreSQL database. They use
`supertest` to call the running Nest application and verify persistence,
auth, and business-rule enforcement end-to-end.

Run locally (requires a running Postgres — `docker compose up` is the
easiest way):

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

The e2e suite needs the same environment variables as the application.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in at minimum `DATABASE_URL`,
`JWT_SECRET`, `SOROBAN_RPC_URL`, `TICKETING_CONTRACT_ID`,
`PLATFORM_SIGNER_SECRET`, and the three `OFFLINE_SIGNING_*` values.

### E2E in CI

CI runs the e2e suite in the `e2e-test` job defined in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The job spins up a
`postgres:16` service container, runs `npx prisma migrate deploy` to
apply all migrations, and then runs `npm run test:e2e`. The job
executes on every pull request targeting `main`, so e2e regressions are
caught before merge.

The CI database is isolated (credentials `test/test`, database
`stellar_tickets_test`) and is discarded when the job finishes.

## Seeding for local development

A seed script populates a demo user, organisation, event and ticket
types so you have data to work with immediately:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

Or reset the database and re-seed in one command:

```bash
npm run db:reset   # drops all tables, re-applies migrations, then seeds
```

See [`prisma/seed.ts`](../prisma/seed.ts) for the demo credentials and
what is created.
